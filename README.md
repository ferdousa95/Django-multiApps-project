# django-multiApps-project

This is a very simple project that has an app which uses multiple html files for different webpages. 
Also a hierarchy of html pages are set up so that all the html pages have the same header.
The project was developed in local server but by the help of heruko and gunicorn, is moved to production. 

No database has been used for now.
